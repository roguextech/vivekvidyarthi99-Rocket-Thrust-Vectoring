## Welcome to Hades

Hades is an extremely small scale rocket that is built to perform identically to commercial large scale rocket. In order to follow this philosophy, we are using the most efficient/low-powered parts as possible. Our flight computer consists of an Arduino Micro, which uses the ATmega32U processor, which handles pyro events, stabilization through thrust vectoring, and landing procedures.
## Current Progress
## As of Dec 2018:
1. Single Stage Thrust Vectoring Development
2. Pyro Events
